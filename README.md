## Examples

You can run any [example](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/tree/main/examples) using the command `cargo run --example <example-name>`

Example :
  
```bash
cargo run --example get_quorum_count
```

## Contract Bindings

The main branch of this repo is intended to be syncronized with mainnet version of core contracts.

To update the bindings of this repo, run:

```bash
make bindings
```

This command will generate the bindings files in the folder: `crates/utils`.

**Important:** this command requires Docker installed and running since it uses a container to generate the bindings. On Mac, you may get an error similar to:

```text
v0.3.0: Pulling from foundry-rs/foundry
docker: no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8 in the manifest list entries.
```

In that case, you'll need to pull the foundry image for the `amd64` platform with:

```bash
docker pull --platform linux/amd64/v8 ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:v0.3.0
```

And then run `make bindings` again.

## Contributor Guidelines

We are actively looking for contributors. Thank you for your interest. We have strict ci checks in place. In case of any questions and support, feel free to raise an issue.

## Branches

- `main` - Points to the  latest **mainnet** release of contracts.
- `testnet` - Points to the latest **testnet** release of contracts.
- `dev` - Points to the latest **dev** branch of the contracts.

### PR

To test locally :-

You need `foundry` to successfully run it.

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

On Mac, you might get an error similar to:

```bash
Error starting anvil container: Client(PullImage { descriptor: "ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest", err: DockerStreamError { error: "no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8 in the manifest list entries" } })
```

In that case, you'll need to pull the foundry image for the `amd64` platform with:

```bash
docker pull --platform linux/amd64/v8 ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest
```

At least 1 `approving` review is required to merge the PR.
  
### lint

```bash
make lint
```

### To run fireblocks tests

Add the following variables to your env

- FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY
- FIREBLOCKS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH
- FIREBLOCKS_API_URL

 and then run the following command

```bash
make fireblocks-tests

```

### Test Coverage

Test coverage should aim to be around 80%.

Here's how to generate test coverage reports:

Install llvm tools:

```bash
make deps
```

Run the tests with coverage instrumentations:

```bash
make coverage
```

Open the coverage html report in a web browser:

```sh
open target/llvm-cov/html/index.html
```
