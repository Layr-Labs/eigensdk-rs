# Release Process

> [!WARNING]
> üèóÔ∏è This document is a Work-in-Progress üöß

- [ ] Go to the "Draft a new release" page ([link](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/releases/new)).

- [ ] Generate a new tag for the release by pressing on "Choose a tag", writing the version number `vX.Y.Z`, and pressing on "Create new tag: `vX.Y.Z`".

- [ ] Adjust the release target or previous tag if needed.

- [ ] Press on "Generate release notes" to autogenerate the changelog.

- [ ] Verify that there aren't any missing commits in the autogenerated changelog.

- [ ] Create a new branch for the release.

- [ ] Merge the autogenerated changelog with the change descriptions on the `CHANGELOG.md` changelog's "[Unreleased]" section.

- [ ] Add any missing descriptions to the changelog items. It's recommended that every item that's not in "Documentation" or "Other Changes" has a description of what changed and instructions on how to migrate. You can encounter examples in previous changelog entries.

- [ ] Bump the version in the workspace's `Cargo.toml`, careful of following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

- [ ] Commit the changelog and `Cargo.toml` changes and submit a PR.

- [ ] Sync the release draft description with the changelog and save the draft.

- [ ] Once the draft is reviewed, the PR is merged, and the CI run on the release branch succeeds, publish the release.
