### Other Changes

## [0.2.0] - 2025-02-06

### Security üîí

* chore(deps): bump openssl from 0.10.68 to 0.10.70 in the cargo group across 1 directory by @dependabot in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/291>

### Added üéâ

* Added `eigen_common` dependency to the `eigensdk` crate when "full" feature is enabled in [#249](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/249).
  * Now when enabling the "full" feature:

    ```toml
    eigensdk = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
    ```

    You can use access the `eigen-common` crate as a submodule of `eigensdk`:

    ```rust
    use eigensdk::common::*;
    ```

* Added bindings for `ECDSAStakeRegistry` and `ECDSAServiceManagerBase` in [#269](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/269).
  * These bindings can be accessed from:

    ```rust
    // From `eigensdk`
    use eigensdk::utils::middleware::ecdsaservicemanagerbase;
    use eigensdk::utils::middleware::ecdsastakeregistry;
    // From `eigen_utils`
    use eigen_utils::middleware::ecdsaservicemanagerbase;
    use eigen_utils::middleware::ecdsastakeregistry;
    ```

* Starting on this release, we're using [`release-plz`](https://github.com/release-plz/release-plz) to streamline our release process.
  * Added release-plz in ci in [#275](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/275).
  * Added custom configuration for release-plz in [#281](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/281).
  * Fixed typo in release-plz toml file in [#284](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/284).

### Breaking Changes üõ†

* fix: use rewards coordinator on get operator avs/pi split methods by @maximopalopoli in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/250>

  * The parameters of `ChainReader::new` changed, and it now receives the address of the rewards coordinator.

    It was previously called this way:

    ```rust
    let el_chain_reader = ELChainReader::new(
        logger,
        SLASHER_ADDRESS,
        DELEGATION_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
        AVS_DIRECTORY_ADDRESS,
        provider_url,
    );
    ```

    Now, it's called this way:

    ```rust
    let el_chain_reader = ELChainReader::new(
        logger,
        SLASHER_ADDRESS,
        DELEGATION_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
        REWARDS_COORDINATOR,
        AVS_DIRECTORY_ADDRESS,
        provider_url,
    );
    ```

### Removed üóë

* Removed homepage from testing-utils crate in [#266](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/266).
* Removed changelog generation by release-plz in [#281](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/281).
* Removed examples packages from workspace.dependencies in Cargo.toml in [#287](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/287).
* Removed release-plz-pr workflow in release-plz in [#292](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/292).

### Documentation üìö

* Fixed the rewardsv2 bindings version in readme to 0.5.4 in [#246](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/246).
* docs: improve changelog by adding examples by @maximopalopoli in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/251>

### Other Changes

* Changes in the way bindings are generated in [#243](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/243).
  * The `bindings` target now generates the bindings using Docker with Foundry v0.3.0.
  * The previous `bindings` target was renamed to `bindings_host`, as it runs without Docker. However the `bindings_host` target is for CI use only. To generate the bindings, please use the `bindings` target.
* Fixed incorrect package name in Cargo.toml for examples in [#285](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/285).
* docs: add mention of updated bindings to changelog by @MegaRedHand in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/233>
* chore: format contracts by @ricomateo in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/235>
* ci: add foundry workflow by @ricomateo in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/236>
* ci: add CI job to check whether anvil state is up to date by @ricomateo in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/237>
* chore: remove existing bindings when generating new ones by @ricomateo in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/242>
* chore: remove alloy reexported crates from dependencies by @ricomateo in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/244>

## [0.1.3] - 2025-01-17

### Added üéâ

* feat: add rewards-v2 related functionality by @supernovahs in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/221>
  * New methods in `ELChainReader`:
    * `get_operator_avs_split`

    ```rust
    // Given a chain_reader, an operator_address and an avs_address:

    let split = el_chain_reader
        .get_operator_avs_split(operator_address, avs_address)
        .await
        .unwrap();
    ```

    * `get_operator_pi_split`

    ```rust
    // Given a chain_reader and an operator_address:

    let split = el_chain_writer
        .el_chain_reader
        .get_operator_pi_split(operator_address)
        .await
        .unwrap();
    ```

  * New methods in `ELChainWriter`:
    * `set_operator_avs_split`

    ```rust
    // Given a chain_writer, an operator_address, an avs_address and a split:

    let tx_hash = el_chain_writer
        .set_operator_avs_split(operator_address, avs_address, split)
        .await
        .unwrap();
    let receipt = wait_transaction(&http_endpoint, tx_hash).await.unwrap();
    ```

    * `set_operator_pi_split`

    ```rust
    // Given a chain_writer, an operator_address and a split:

    let tx_hash = el_chain_writer
        .set_operator_pi_split(operator, split)
        .await
        .unwrap();
    let receipt = wait_transaction(&http_endpoint, tx_hash).await.unwrap();
    ```

  * Bindings updated for rewards-v2 core contracts release

### Breaking Changes üõ†

* feat!: remove delegation manager from `ELChainWriter` by @supernovahs in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/214>
  * `ELChainWriter::new` no longer receives the delegation manager address as first parameter.
    Before, a chainWriter was created this way:

    ```rust
        let el_writer = ELChainWriter::new(
            DELEGATION_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
            STRATEGY_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
            REWARDS_COORDINATOR,
            el_chain_reader,
            "https://ethereum-holesky.blockpi.network/v1/rpc/public".to_string(),
            "bead471191bea97fc3aeac36c9d74c895e8a6242602e144e43152f96219e96e8".to_string(),
        );
    ```

    Now, the creation is done without the delegation manager address:

    ```rust
        let el_writer = ELChainWriter::new(
            STRATEGY_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
            REWARDS_COORDINATOR,
            el_chain_reader,
            "<https://ethereum-holesky.blockpi.network/v1/rpc/public>".to_string(),
            "bead471191bea97fc3aeac36c9d74c895e8a6242602e144e43152f96219e96e8".to_string(),
        );
    ```

* feat!: change way bindings are generated by @MegaRedHand in <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/204>
  * `eigen_utils::core` contains bindings related to core contracts
  * `eigen_utils::middleware` contains bindings related to middleware contracts
  * `eigen_utils::sdk` contains bindings related to the SDK (should only be used for testing)
  
  Now, to update the bindings, run `make bindings`. This command will generate the bindings files in the folder: `crates/utils`.
