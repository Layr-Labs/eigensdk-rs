## [Unreleased]
### Added
* Added `eigen_common` dependency to the `eigensdk` crate when "full" feature is enabled in [#249](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/249).
* Added bindings for `ECDSAStakeRegistry` and `ECDSAServiceManagerBase` in [#269](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/269).
* Added release-plz in ci in [#275](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/275).
* Added new method `set_slashable_stake_lookahead` in `avsregistry/writer` in [#278](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/278).
  ```rust
    let quorum_number = 0_u8;
    let lookahead = 10_u32;
    let tx_hash = avs_writer
        .set_slashable_stake_lookahead(quorum_number, lookahead)
        .await
        .unwrap();
  ```
* Added new method `set_rewards_initiator` in `avsregistry/writer` in [#273](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/273).
  ```rust
    let tx_hash = avs_writer
      .set_rewards_initiator(new_rewards_init_address)
      .await
      .unwrap();
  ```
* Added new method `clear_deallocation_queue` in `elcontracts/writer` in [#270](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/270)
  ```rust
  let tx_hash_clear = el_chain_writer
      .clear_deallocation_queue(
          operator_address,
          vec![strategy_addr],
          vec![num_to_clear],
      )
      .await
      .unwrap();
  ```
* Added update_socket function for avs registry writer in [#268](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/268)
  An example of use is the following:
  ```rust
  // Given an avs writer and a new socket address:

  let tx_hash = avs_writer
    .update_socket(new_socket_addr.into())
    .await
    .unwrap();

  let tx_status = wait_transaction(&http_endpoint, tx_hash)
    .await
    .unwrap()
    .status(); 
  // tx_status should be true
  ```
* Added custom configuration for release-plz in [#281](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/281).

### Changed
* Changes in the way bindings are generated in [#243](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/243).
  * The `bindings` target now generates the bindings using Docker with Foundry v0.3.0.
  * The previous `bindings` target was renamed to `bindings_host`, as it runs without Docker. However the `bindings_host` target is for CI use only. To generate the bindings, please use the `bindings` target.
* Fixed the rewardsv2 bindings version in readme to 0.5.4 in [#246](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/246).
* Fixed typo in release-plz toml file in [#284](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/284).
* Fixed incorrect package name in Cargo.toml for examples in [#285](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/285).

### Breaking changes
* refactor: update interface on `bls aggregation` in [#254](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/254)
  * Introduces a new struct `TaskMetadata` with a constructor `TaskMetadata::new` to initialize a new task and a method `with_window_duration` to set the window duration.
  * Refactors `initialize_new_task` and `single_task_aggregator` to accept a `TaskMetadata` struct instead of multiple parameters.
    ```rust
    // BEFORE
    bls_agg_service
          .initialize_new_task(
              task_index,
              block_number as u32,
              quorum_numbers,
              quorum_threshold_percentages,
              time_to_expiry,
          )
          .await
          .unwrap();
    
    // AFTER
    let metadata = TaskMetadata::new(
            task_index,
            block_number,
            quorum_numbers,
            quorum_threshold_percentages,
            time_to_expiry,
      )
    bls_agg_service.initialize_new_task(metadata).await.unwrap();
    ```
    
  * Removes `initialize_new_task_with_window` since `window_duration` can now be set in `TaskMetadata`.
    ```rust
    // BEFORE
    bls_agg_service
          .initialize_new_task_with_window(
              task_index,
              block_number as u32,
              quorum_numbers,
              quorum_threshold_percentages,
              time_to_expiry,
              window_duration,
          )
          .await
          .unwrap();

    // AFTER
    let metadata = TaskMetadata::new(
            task_index,
            block_number,
            quorum_numbers,
            quorum_threshold_percentages,
            time_to_expiry,
        ).with_window_duration(window_duration);
    bls_agg_service.initialize_new_task(metadata).await.unwrap();
* refactor: encapsulate parameters into `TaskSignature` in [#260](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/260) 
  * Introduced `TaskSignature` struct to encapsulate parameters related to task signatures:
  * Updated `process_new_signature` to accept a `TaskSignature` struct instead of multiple parameters.
    ```rust
    // BEFORE
    bls_agg_service.process_new_signature(task_index, task_response_digest, bls_signature, operator_id).await.unwrap();

    // AFTER
    let task_signature = TaskSignature::new(
          task_index,
          task_response_digest,
          bls_signature,
          operator_id,
    );
    bls_agg_service.process_new_signature(task_signature).await.unwrap();
    ```
* Slashing UAM changes in [#248](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/248).

### Removed

## [0.1.3] - 2024-01-17
### Added ðŸŽ‰
* feat: add rewards-v2 related functionality by @supernovahs in https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/221
  * New methods in `ELChainReader`:
    * `get_operator_avs_split`
    ```rust
    // Given a chain_reader, an operator_address and an avs_address:

    let split = el_chain_reader
        .get_operator_avs_split(operator_address, avs_address)
        .await
        .unwrap();
    ```
    
    * `get_operator_pi_split`
    ```rust
    // Given a chain_reader and an operator_address:

    let split = el_chain_writer
        .el_chain_reader
        .get_operator_pi_split(operator_address)
        .await
        .unwrap();
    ```

  * New methods in `ELChainWriter`:
    * `set_operator_avs_split`
    ```rust
    // Given a chain_writer, an operator_address, an avs_address and a split:

    let tx_hash = el_chain_writer
        .set_operator_avs_split(operator_address, avs_address, split)
        .await
        .unwrap();
    let receipt = wait_transaction(&http_endpoint, tx_hash).await.unwrap();
    ```
    * `set_operator_pi_split`
    ```rust
    // Given a chain_writer, an operator_address and a split:

    let tx_hash = el_chain_writer
        .set_operator_pi_split(operator, split)
        .await
        .unwrap();
    let receipt = wait_transaction(&http_endpoint, tx_hash).await.unwrap();
    ```
  * Bindings updated for rewards-v2 core contracts release

### Breaking Changes ðŸ› 
* feat!: remove delegation manager from `ELChainWriter` by @supernovahs in https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/214
  * `ELChainWriter::new` no longer receives the delegation manager address as first parameter.
    Before, a chainWriter was created this way:

    ```rust
        let el_writer = ELChainWriter::new(
            DELEGATION_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
            STRATEGY_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
            REWARDS_COORDINATOR,
            el_chain_reader,
            "https://ethereum-holesky.blockpi.network/v1/rpc/public".to_string(),
            "bead471191bea97fc3aeac36c9d74c895e8a6242602e144e43152f96219e96e8".to_string(),
        );
    ```

    Now, the creation is done without the delegation manager address:

    ```rust
        let el_writer = ELChainWriter::new(
            STRATEGY_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
            REWARDS_COORDINATOR,
            el_chain_reader,
            "<https://ethereum-holesky.blockpi.network/v1/rpc/public>".to_string(),
            "bead471191bea97fc3aeac36c9d74c895e8a6242602e144e43152f96219e96e8".to_string(),
        );
    ```
* feat!: change way bindings are generated by @MegaRedHand in https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-rs/pull/204
  * `eigen_utils::core` contains bindings related to core contracts
  * `eigen_utils::middleware` contains bindings related to middleware contracts
  * `eigen_utils::sdk` contains bindings related to the SDK (should only be used for testing)
  
  Now, to update the bindings, run `make bindings`. This command will generate the bindings files in the folder: `crates/utils`.
